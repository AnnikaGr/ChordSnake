# ChordSnake

## Game Description
A snake game with the goal of teaching chord progressions of different songs. This is useful to musicians who want to play their favorite songs spontaneously!

The goal of the game is to collect all chords of the chosen song in the right order on the snake. To collect a chord, the player has to navigate the snake to it and enter the note of the chord correctly in the popup view that opens on encounter of the chord field. Once all the chords are collected on the snake (or saved in the bottom saving grid and the rest collected on the snake) the game is won.

There are different bonus functionalities such as deleting the last chord if it was collected accidentally/wrongly and saving the collected chords to a grid to shorten the snake. 

The player can choose 3 different difficulty levels depending on the song you choose. Moreover, you can choose different instruments to receive suitable audio feedback during the game depending on your instrument. You can also study the chord progression of your selected song before starting the game and listen to the saved collected chords once you are in the game.
